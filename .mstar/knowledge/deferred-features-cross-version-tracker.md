# Deferred Features — Cross-Version Tracker v2

**Quick status**: **V1.77 active (2026-06-30)** — Findings-Remediation UI (quality loop closure) + post-canvas-program inflection. Track A (P0) promotes the Control-Room findings view from read-only (V1.64) to a full remediation authoring surface (6-state status transitions + target_executor assignment + inline edit), consuming the PATCH route the backend already ships. Track B (P1) closed 3 V1.76-QC residuals. The canvas program (V1.67–V1.76, 10 iterations) is **complete** — Strategy/Outline+Timeline/World KB/Relationships all shipped β/γ. Platform **paused**. Residuals SSOT: [`status.json`](../status.json). Shipped/cancelled history: [shipped-features-tracker.md](../archived/shipped-features-tracker.md).

**Purpose**: Single source of truth for **open** and **backlog** features deferred from delivery compasses. Closed/shipped history lives in shipped archive.
**Scope**: `nexus` OSS repository only.
**Created**: 2026-04-21 · **Last updated**: 2026-06-30 (V1.77 P-last: canvas program complete; findings-remediation UI shipped; 3 V1.76 residuals closed; 12 V1.78 QC-suggestion residuals registered)

## 1) How to use

- **Product decisions**: §2.1 (PD-*)
- **Future product lines**: §2.2 (FL-*)
- **Planning a new version**: Scan §2.3 Open features for items targeting that version or "Any future"
- **Closing an item**: Remove its row from §2.3; append to [shipped archive](../archived/shipped-features-tracker.md)
- **Deferring again**: Update `Target` column; keep the row. Add a note.
- **Shipped/cancelled history**: [shipped archive](../archived/shipped-features-tracker.md)
- **Tech-debt residuals**: [`status.json`](../status.json) `residual_findings` — SSOT. Do not mirror here.
- **Conflict**: Compass wins over tracker; `status.json` wins over tracker for machine-state residuals.

### 2.1 Program planning decisions

| ID | Decision | Notes |
|----|----------|-------|
| PD-01 | **World fork is platform-only** | Community/social feature; **no** local `nexus42` CLI or daemon fork. |
| PD-05 | Cloud sync is **not** a short-term iteration focus | CLI `sync push/pull` unchanged; orchestration `sync.pull`/`sync.push` stubs remain Open. |

## 3) Residuals (SSOT pointer)

Residual findings are tracked in [`status.json`](../status.json) → `residual_findings` + `metadata.tech_debt_summary`. The tracker does **not** mirror residual rows — `status.json` is authoritative. Current state: 9 open V1.60 residuals (all low, V1.61+). Closed/historical: `.mstar/archived/residuals/<plan-id>.json`.

---

## 4) Change control

- **Shipped rows**: Move from §2.3 to [shipped archive](../archived/shipped-features-tracker.md) §1; add per-version snapshot to archive §2 when an iteration closes.
- **Compass authority**: Active compass controls scope even if this tracker lists a different target.
- **Effort estimates**: XS/S/M/L/XL agent-session scale. Guidance only.
