# Deferred Features — Cross-Version Tracker v1

**Quick status**: **V1.60 Shipped (2026-06-23)** — DF-46 Local Capability Parity (5 orchestration capabilities; roster 27→32 shipped) & Script Profile Depth 3.5 (Draft→Master). Dual-track single-wave; 5 plans all Done. 9 low V1.60 residuals deferred to V1.61+. **V1.61 Prepare active** — Programmable Narrative Progression (WASM compute for timeline narrative; XL; 6 plans; 4 waves). Platform **paused**. Tech debt SSOT: [`status.json`](../status.json)

**Status**: V1.58–V1.60 Shipped & MERGED to main. **V1.61 Active** (Prepare). **S-A + S-B dual track** (V1.51–V1.60 rhythm). V1.60: dual-track single-wave (DF-46 Track A 5 orchestration capabilities + Script Depth 3.5 Track B). V1.61: 4-wave topology (schemas → {KB layer ∥ wasm-host} → orchestration → daemon); 6 plans registered; XL iteration.

**V1.58 carry-forward index**: 33 of 35 V1.57+/V1.58+ open residuals closed + DF-44 fully closed. Track A: P0 closed 19 (R-V156P0-M001..M006 workspace OCC; R-V156P1-M003..M005 capability surface; R-V156P1-L001..L007 polish; R-V156-PROCESS-01 + R-V156P1-CACHE-01 sqlx hygiene; R-V156-MIDQA-01 fmt drift; R-V157P0-L001/L002 V1.57-new). P2 closed 14 (R-V156P2-M001..M003 + L001..L004 DF-56 independent; R-V156P2-CACHE-01 engine test fidelity; R-V156P3-W001/W002 + S001/S002/S004 DF-56 dependent; R-V157P1-W001 host-call smoke). Track B: DF-44 closed end-to-end across P1 (capability + DB migration + reference-knowledge.md Draft spec) + P3 (CLI + cross-cut tests + body file write + topology). **Deferred to V1.59+ WL-A**: 14 V1.52-era polish residuals (R-V150KBED-02, R-V151Q1-10, R-V152TA-S001..S011, R-V152TB-W006/W007/W008) — explicitly out of V1.58 scope per compass §6.

**DF-46 reduction note (V1.57)**: DF-46 "Full `nexus.*` logical capability implementation" was the longest-standing open feature (V1.34). V1.57 reduces it to "Roster-documented: 41 rows = 18 `shipped` + 18 `catalog-only` + 3 `scaffold-equivalent` + 2 `OUT` (publish.* per DF-59)". 2 publish.* IDs remain in catalog as `OUT` (DF-59 platform publish — platform/V2.0+ dependency). Roster is the SSOT for capability coverage; future `nexus.*` additions must register in both `capability::Registry` and the acp §4 roster (cross-validation enforced by `catalog_registry_invariant_all_ids_present` test).

**V1.55 carry-forward index (closed in V1.55)**: DF-43 → V1.55 P0 (`2026-06-22-v1.55-df43-sqlite-alignment`) — **Closed**; DF-31 → V1.55 P1 (`2026-06-22-v1.55-df31-workspace-interface`) — **Skeleton shipped**; game-bible Depth 3.5 → V1.55 P2 (`2026-06-22-v1.55-game-bible-depth-35`) — **Shipped**; Script scaffold → V1.55 P3 (`2026-06-22-v1.55-script-scaffold`) — **Shipped**; `R-V154P1-S002` → V1.55 P2 — **Resolved**; `R-V154P1-W001` → V1.55 P3 — **Resolved**.
**Purpose**: Single source of truth for **open** and **backlog** features/tech-debt deferred from delivery compasses. Closed/shipped history lives in [shipped-features-tracker.md](../archived/shipped-features-tracker.md).
**Scope**: `nexus` OSS repository only. Platform features referenced only when they block nexus-side work.
**Predecessor**: Consolidated from delivery compasses (v1.2–v1.21) and the v1.2 reclassification matrix.
**Created**: 2026-04-21
**Last updated**: 2026-06-23 (V1.61 Prepare: V1.60 Shipped via PR #82; V1.61 compass + 6 plan stubs authored; WASM compute feature registered)

## 1) How to use this file

- **Product decisions (not deferrals)**: See §3.1 Program planning decisions (PD-*).
- **Future product lines (cross-version themes)**: See §3.2 Future product lines (FL-*).
- **Planning a new version**: Scan §3.3 Open features for items targeting that version or "Any future".
- **Closing an item**: Remove its row from §3.3; append to [shipped-features-tracker.md](../archived/shipped-features-tracker.md) with completion version, plan-id, and note.
- **Deferring again**: Update the `Target` column; keep the row in §3.3. Add a note in `Deferral history`.
- **Shipped / cancelled history**: [shipped-features-tracker.md](../archived/shipped-features-tracker.md) (§1 closed items, §2 per-version snapshots).
- **Tech-debt residuals**: [`status.json`](../status.json) → `residual_findings` + `metadata.tech_debt_summary` (§3.5 pointer only).
- **Source of truth**: This file is the **tracker**; the **compass** of the active version is the **scope authority**. If this file and the active compass conflict, the compass wins.

## 2) Lifecycle status definitions

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Open** | Item has not been implemented. May have a target version assigned, or be in backlog. |
| **Shipped** | Implemented and merged in the indicated version (record in archive). |
| **Cancelled** | Explicitly removed from scope (no longer planned). |
| **Superseded** | Replaced by a different approach; original item no longer relevant. |

## 3) Open items

### 3.1 Program planning decisions

Recorded product rulings for iteration planning. **Not** implementation tasks — the active delivery compass is scope authority. Closed PD-02..12 → [shipped archive §2](../archived/shipped-features-tracker.md).

| ID | Decision | Notes |
|----|----------|-------|
| PD-01 | **World fork is platform-only** | Community/social feature; **no** local `nexus42` CLI or daemon fork. See DF-45 (Cancelled) in archive. |
| PD-05 | Cloud sync is **not** a short-term iteration focus | CLI `sync push/pull` unchanged; orchestration `sync.pull`/`sync.push` stubs remain Open |
| PD-08 | Preset orchestration + Agentic Design Patterns | See FL-D; research: https://github.com/evoiz/Agentic-Design-Patterns |

### 3.2 Future product lines (planning backlog)

Cross-version themes. Suggested targets are non-binding until locked in a compass. Shipped FL-A/B → archive §2 V1.29.

| ID | Product line | Suggested target | Notes |
|----|--------------|------------------|-------|
| FL-D | **Preset orchestration** (Agentic Design Patterns) | Post-V1.34 | V1.31–32 shipped capabilities + quality gate; **still open**: DF-29, DF-31, **conditional routing** (DF-56; OUT of V1.34) |
| FL-E | **Generic creator workflow** (intake → research → draft → review → persist) | **V1.34** | **Shipped in V1.34** — [creator-workflow.md](specs/creator-workflow.md) (Status: Shipped V1.34) + compass [v1.34](../iterations/v1.34-creator-workflow-and-agent-tools-delivery-compass-v1.md). FL-E closed in V1.34 with 5 plan P0–P5; minimal preset chain (research → produce → review → persist) + Work `stage`/`stage_status` + linear gates + active schedule uniqueness (P1) + preset chain wiring (P2). `--auto-chain` default still DF-53. |

#### DF-43 decision note — Reference sources persistence

**Status:** **Closed in V1.55 P0** (2026-06-22).

1. **`nexus-local-db`** owns production `reference_sources` in `state.db` — confirmed sole persistence owner.
2. **`nexus-knowledge::ReferenceSource`** remains as domain model / adapter seam. `From<ReferenceSourceRow>` adapter lives in `nexus-local-db`.
3. `nexus-knowledge` crate docs and AGENTS.md explicitly state no second SQLite/file-backed truth source.

See plan: [2026-06-22-v1.55-df43-sqlite-alignment.md](../plans/2026-06-22-v1.55-df43-sqlite-alignment.md).

**V1.55 ship residual retargeting**: All 2 V1.54 carry-forwards closed in V1.55. `R-V154P1-S002` resolved in P2 (profile-gate observability); `R-V154P1-W001` resolved in P3 (ScaffoldTransaction). `R-V155P2-F002` (V1.55-internal; design-writing preset no durable section_status auto-transition) **absorbed into V1.56 P-last fix-wave** per compass Q7 → **Closed in V1.56 P-last** (no carry-forward to V1.57).

**V1.56 ship residual retargeting (V1.57 carry-forwards)**: 3 V1.56 medium/low residuals absorbed into V1.57 plan slots per V1.57 carry-forward index above. Lifecycle stays `deferred` until the absorbing plan ships and resolves the row. 32 V1.57+ residuals remain in backlog (out of V1.57 scope: R-V156P0-M001 sha2 dep + R-V156P0-M002 path canonicalize stay V1.58+ workspace concerns per compass §1.2).

**Machine state**: [`status.json`](../status.json) → `residual_findings` + `metadata.tech_debt_summary` (`status.json.updated_at` **2026-06-22T22:30:00Z**; iteration state: V1.57 Active; `integration_branch=iteration/v1.57` (created from main @ 329c5ff2); `integration_branch_retired=false`; `pre_implement_gate=pending`; `latest_active_iteration=V1.57`; `latest_ship.iteration=V1.56` (`merge_commit=8a2fb20e`, `pr=78`); 3 V1.57 carry-forwards registered (R-V156P1-M001→P2, R-V156P1-M002→P1, R-V156P3-S003→P1); 32 V1.57+ backlog residuals). Do **not** mirror full rows here — JSON wins on conflict. Closed/historical rows: `.mstar/archived/residuals/<plan-id>.json`.

| Bucket | Open count | `residual_findings` key |
|--------|------------|-------------------------|

| V1.55 internal (V1.55 ship) | **0** | 1 low: `R-V155P2-F002` → closed in V1.56 P-last fix-wave (no V1.57 carry-forward) |
| V1.56 carry-forward (V1.56 ship) | **3** | 1 medium + 1 medium + 1 low; absorbed into V1.57 plan slots per V1.57 carry-forward index above |
| V1.56 internal (V1.56 ship, V1.57+ backlog) | **32** | 17 medium + 15 low; in V1.57+ backlog (out of V1.57 scope per compass §1.2) |

### 3.6 Reference system distills (V1.36 baseline)

**Purpose**: capture research snapshots of production-grade reference systems that informed V1.36 spec/plan decisions. Future iterations (V1.37+) may extend these distills or use them as a research starting point when re-opening the deferred items above.

#### 3.6.1 Novels-system V1.36 baseline (2026-06-07)

**Source**: internal reference at `~/workspace/organizations/42ch/internal-sharing/novels-system/` (Obsidian + Redis + InStreet literary API; multi-novel, multi-role, multi-chapter serial production system).

**Distilled by**: `@project-manager` (PM), 2026-06-07 V1.36 prepare wave (after V1.35 shipped, before P0 dispatch). Audit evidence: [v1.36-pending-delivery-compass.md §0.1 grill decisions](../iterations/v1.36-pending-delivery-compass.md) + novels-system files: `shared-rules/novel-system-rules.md` (790 lines), `cron-prompts/{novel-brainstorm,novel-write,novel-review,novel-publish}.md`, `schemas/{novel-active,novel-state,novel-review-iteration}.schema.json`, `templates/novel/*.md` (20 templates).

**V1.36 north star** (from compass §0): *Complete the novel-writing正文产出 journey on generic Work — from project scaffold through one polished chapter — without platform publish and without legacy layout shims.*

##### Capability matrix (novels-system × V1.36 disposition)

##### V1.36 implementation of in-scope items (PM approved 2026-06-07)

| novels-system feature | V1.36 implementation | Spec/plan ref |
|---|---|---|
| Chapter finalize quality gate (五问) | `exit_when: kind: llm_judge` on `finalize` state in `novel-writing` preset; template `finalize-exit.md` | novel-workflow-profile §5.1; plan P3 T7 |
| 6-column chapter table | **Migrated to `work_chapters` DB table** (chapter table removed from work-status.md file) | novel-workflow-profile §4.1.1/§4.1.2/§4.1.3; plan P2 T10/T12/T13 |
| `volume: integer` frontmatter | Forward-compat field; V1.36 leaves blank | novel-workflow-profile §4.3; plan P2 T9 |

| **`work-status.md` file** | **REMOVED**; chapter state lives in `work_chapters` table; reconciliation via `creator run reconcile-chapters` | novel-workflow-profile §3.1/§4.1; plan P2 T10/T12/T13 |
| **Per-Work `Worldbuilding/` subtree** | **REMOVED**; world content lives in World KB (per [entity-scope-model.md](specs/entity-scope-model.md) §5.4); worldless Works put setting notes in `README.md` | novel-workflow-profile §3.5/§3.1; plan P1/P2 |

##### V1.41 distill overlay (grill-me 2026-06-10 — supersedes OUT rows above for DF-60/61)

| novels-system pattern | V1.41 OSS mapping | Plan |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Redis `novel:active` | `novel_pool_entries.status = active` — **CLI default only**; concurrent multi-Work OK | P1 pool + P0 `works use` |
| 8-step switch / 2h lock | **OUT** — `.completion-lock.json` per completed Work; no global mutex | P0 lifecycle |
| `选题库` / `灵感池` | DB SSOT; `{workspace}/Pool/Ideas/*.md` for inspiration files | P1 |
| CLI | `creator works` (list/status/use/pool); `creator run` single-Work actions; `--from-work` | P0 + P1 |

Normative: [v1.41-multi-work-author-desk-delivery-compass-v1.md](../iterations/v1.41-multi-work-author-desk-delivery-compass-v1.md) §0.1.

##### Re-open instructions for V1.37+ implementers

When V1.37+ picks up multi-chapter or multi-novel work:

1. **Read** the novels-system source files listed above (`shared-rules/novel-system-rules.md` is the SSOT; cross-reference `cron-prompts/` for behavior contracts).
2. **For each V1.36+ deferred item (DF-60..DF-67)**, design a plan that maps the reference pattern to OSS constraints:
   - Replace Redis → local DB table
   - Replace Obsidian file tree → `Works/<work_ref>/` subdir
   - Replace InStreet literary API → CLI-only or platform `nexus-cloud-sync` boundary
   - Replace cron schedule → orchestration `Schedule` with `fl_e_stage` wire key (per [creator-schedule-and-core-context.md](creator-schedule-and-core-context.md))
3. **Update the spec the spec covers**:
   - DF-60/61 → new spec `novel-writing/multi-work-lifecycle.md` (or extension to novel-workflow-profile)
   - DF-62 → new spec section in novel-workflow-profile §3.1 + chapter frontmatter becomes required
   - DF-63 → extend `entity-scope-model.md` World KB taxonomy and `novel-writing/workflow-profile.md` World integration sections (do **not** reintroduce a per-Work Worldbuilding spec or subtree)
   - DF-64/67 → `novel-writing/workflow-profile.md` §5.5 quality-loop roadmap extension first; a future large implementation may split into `novel-writing/quality-loop.md` if the section outgrows the profile
   - DF-65 → `novel-writing/workflow-profile.md` §5.5.4 rules architecture first; a future large implementation may split into `novel-rules-architecture.md`
   - DF-66 → `novel-writing/workflow-profile.md` §5.5.5 `Logs/` section extension
4. **Register the new spec + plan in `status.json`** per mstar-plan-artifacts lifecycle.
5. **Update the deferred tracker** to record the new spec/plan closure (per §4 change control).

#### 3.6.3 DF-56 conditional routing — **CLOSED (all 5 post-V1.42 slices shipped in V1.56 P2+P3)**

> **DF-56 is FULLY CLOSED.** The 5-item "Deferred Post-V1.42" list below is **historical only** — all slices were shipped in V1.56:
> - V1.56 P2 shipped "arbitrary stage conditional + expression routing + converge nodes" (independent slice: T1-T4, commits on `feature/v1.56-df56-independent-slice`).
> - V1.56 P3 shipped "registry.refresh conditional edges + workspace branch inputs" (dependent slice: T1-T5, commits on `feature/v1.56-df56-dependent-slice`).
> - `preset-conditional-routing.md` header Status shows V1.56 P2+P3 Shipped. DF-56 is NOT in §3.3 open-features table (closed). The deferred-features-tracker quick-status and §3.6.3 were stale; corrected 2026-06-22 (V1.59 Prepare audit).

**Shipped in V1.42 P2 (minimal slice)** — commits on `feature/v1.42-conditional-routing`:

| Task | Commit | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| T1 | `5467eaa2` | Spec promoted from Exploration to Draft V1.42 |
| T2 | `e81412e6` | `GoNogoNext` struct + `NextTarget::GoNogo` variant; loader validation; `add_conditional_edge` wiring; reachability via both branches |
| T3 | `c8b1cb5c` | `StateCompositeTask::judge_next_action` — GoNogo returns `Continue` for both GO and NOGO; Linear/None preserves existing behavior |
| T4 | `3153a7bd` | 12 hermetic tests (6 loader + 6 executor); reachability validator traverses GoNogo edges |

Runtime behavior: `_judge_result` in `graph_flow::Context` drives the conditional edge. `true` → `go` target; `false` or absent → `nogo` target (safe fallback).

**Deferred Post-V1.42** (HISTORICAL — all 5 items below shipped in V1.56 P2+P3; retained for audit trail only):

- Arbitrary stage-level conditional `next` (non-judge nodes)
- Expression / rule-based routing beyond GO/NOGO
- `registry.refresh` conditional edges (depends on DF-29)
- `workspace.open` / `workspace.commit` branch inputs (depends on DF-31)
- Multi-branch graphs with >2 outgoing edges and merge points

#### 3.6.2 Future distills

Future iterations may add new distills here. Each distill should be a single subsection with:

- Source (path / URL / repo)
- Distilled by + date
- Iteration that consumed it
- Capability matrix (source system × OSS disposition)
- Implementation table (in-scope items × spec/plan ref)
- Re-open instructions

This convention is established by the V1.36 novels-system distill above. Extend, do not replace.

---

## 4) Change control

- **Shipped rows**: Move from §3.3 to [shipped-features-tracker.md](../archived/shipped-features-tracker.md) §1; add per-version snapshot to archive §2 when an iteration closes.
- **Compass authority**: Active compass controls scope even if this tracker lists a different target.
- **Effort estimates**: XS/S/M/L/XL agent-session scale; guidance only. See `effort-estimation.md`.
- **Residual detail**: `status.json` wins over this file for machine-state residuals.
