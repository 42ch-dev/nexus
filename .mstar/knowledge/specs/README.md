# Specs (`knowledge/specs/`)

Functional and normative specifications for the Nexus OSS repo.

**Rules (invariants):** [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)  
**Machine state:** [`.mstar/status.json`](../../status.json) → `metadata.latest_ship` / `metadata.latest_active_compass`; wave-0 spec per active compass §Normative specs; full index is this README  
**Not here:** trackers and schema-boundary policy → [knowledge root](../README.md); delivery evidence → [iterations](../../iterations/README.md)

---

## Global narrative (first principles)

Nexus OSS specs describe a **local-first creative runtime** with optional cloud mount:

```text
Identity & scope          →  who owns data (Creator, User, World, …)
Architecture & contracts  →  which crate owns which concern; wire vs local types
Runtime topology          →  CLI → daemon → Local API → ACP workers
Persistence               →  state.db, reference store, workspace layout
Orchestration             →  presets, capabilities, schedules, sessions
Product surface (CLI)     →  command IA, entry paths, per-flag behavior
Product lines             →  shipped journeys (Work, FL-E, agent tools, …)
Exploration               →  future engine/product lines without implement authority
```

**Why flat files:** each layer exposes a few long-lived **Master** documents agents can cite by stable basename. Iteration velocity is handled by **Draft overlays** and **compass appendices**, not by renaming or sharding directories.

**Why not one mega-spec:** CLI command detail, orchestration grammar, and ACP hosting evolve on different cadences; Feature line specs record shipped product contracts without bloating Masters.

**Discovery:** this README is the only maintained index. After adding or retiring a spec, update the tables below — do not duplicate the list in AGENTS.md.

## Document classes

| Class | Implement authority | Typical header `Status` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Master | When normative / active | Normative, Active, Accepted |
| Draft overlay | While active compass + Draft | Draft (Vx.xx) |
| Feature line | Yes | Shipped (Vx.xx) |
| Exploration | No | Exploration |
| Companion | OSS scope only | Normative (companion) |
| Legacy scope | Cited subdomain only | Active (legacy scope) |

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for create/extend/merge rules.

## Layout

Spec files live **flat** in this directory except **`novel-writing/`** — the novel `work_profile` subtree (relocated 2026-06-17). See [novel-writing/README.md](novel-writing/README.md) for the domain index.

## Master index (by domain)

*Statuses reflect document headers as of last README maintenance; authoritative per-file header wins on conflict.*

## Normative hierarchy (conflict resolution)

When specs disagree, higher row wins:

1. Repo root **AGENTS.md**
2. Architecture Masters (crate graph, entity scope)
3. Active **iteration compass** (delivery batching only)
4. Domain **Master**
5. Shipped supplement / retained overlay for rationale and acceptance details after Master merge
6. **Feature line** spec
7. **Exploration** (non-binding)

---

## Authority matrix (overlapping topics)

| Topic | Primary SSOT | Secondary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Top-level CLI groups | cli-spec §6.0B | cli-command-ia (Shipped V1.35 supplement) |
| First-run / local vs platform | cli-spec §7 | creator-centric-entry-model (Shipped V1.35 supplement), compass audit appendix |

## Hygiene schedule (consolidation policy)

| Trigger | Required action | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Post-V1.35 CLI changes** | Update cli-spec §6–§7 first; update shipped supplements only when rationale, acceptance, or migration history changes | V1.36-V1.40 amendments folded into Master (no follow-up merge needed yet) |
| **FL-D compass locks implement** | Promote preset-conditional-routing; update orchestration-engine §7.5 | Deferred (FL-D still out of scope) |
| **V1.53 ACP capability registry hygiene** | Promote or retain `capability-registry.md` after P0/P1 registry semantics land; skills-export compatibility spec retired and DF-50 Cancelled | Active V1.53 |
| **Novel-writing sync module removed from code** | Archive novel-writing-sync-contract | Module still shipped (V1.36+); sync contract retained |
| **V1.40 shipped (DF-63 closed)** | Mark `entity-scope-model.md` §5.1.1 + `cli-spec.md` §6.2G + `creator-workflow.md` persist + `local-db-schema.md` §4.1.2 + `novel-writing/workflow-profile.md` §3.5.1 as Shipped V1.40 in their headers | **Done 2026-06-11** (see headers + this index) |
| **V1.41 prep** | Decide which V1.40-tagged open residuals (`status.json.residual_findings`) to address in V1.41 hygiene; re-evaluate DF-60/61/56/47/59 targets | Pending V1.41 compass |

**Retained splits (do not merge):** creator-schedule-and-core-context (schedule domain); ACP cluster (independent evolution cadence).

## Maintaining this index

When adding, renaming, or archiving a spec:

1. Set header **`Status`**, **`Document class`**, and **`Coordinates with`** in the spec file.
2. Update the domain table in this README.
3. Update this README index when specs are added, retired, or promoted; on Prepare, record wave-0 in the iteration compass (not `status.json`).
4. Do **not** add file lists to AGENTS.md.
