## Acceptance criteria

### P3 plan §4
- **AC1: Quickstart Part I copy-pasteable from a fresh install** — PASS
  - Part I §1–§6 now use post-P2 surfaces exclusively:
    - `creator bootstrap --idea "..." --init-preset novel-project-init`
    - `creator run novel-writing <work_id>`
    - `creator works inspire <work_id> --note "..."` (for NOGO recovery and mid-session notes)
    - `creator works status`
    - `creator works resume-chain <work_id>`
    - `creator works reconcile-chapters <work_id>`
    - `creator run reflection-loop <work_id>` (to generate findings)
    - `creator run novel-review-master <work_id>` (and with `--finding-id`, `--auto-schedule`)
    - `creator works completion-lock release` + `creator works reopen` + `creator works resume-chain` for reopen path
    - `creator bootstrap ... --world-id` for new Work in same World
  - All examples are simple, single-line quoted strings with no shell metacharacters; safe for copy-paste on macOS/Linux.
  - Structure is sequential and minimal: prerequisites → bootstrap → status → novel-writing → works commands → quality loop → completion.

- **AC2: No `creator run (start|stage|audit-chapter|review-master)` in quickstart** — PASS
  - `rg -n 'creator run (start|stage|audit-chapter|review-master)' docs/novel-writing-quickstart.md .mstar/knowledge/specs/novel-writing/author-experience.md .mstar/knowledge/specs/novel-writing/quality-loop.md` (limited to the 3 P3 files) returns only one historical explanatory sentence in `novel-writing/quality-loop.md:130`:
    > "3. **§6** remediation hints use `creator run novel-review-master`, not `creator run review-master` — applied P3."
  - Zero active legacy command examples remain in the quickstart or the two author specs.

- **AC3: §5 quality loop uses `creator run novel-review-master` + audit preset ids** — PASS
  - Quickstart §5 now cites:
    - `nexus42 creator run novel-review-master <work_id>`
    - `nexus42 creator run novel-review-master <work_id> --finding-id <finding_id>`
    - `nexus42 creator run novel-review-master <work_id> --auto-schedule`
  - Distinguishes clearly: `creator run reflection-loop` (generates findings via FL-E review stage) vs. `creator run novel-review-master` (decides on existing findings).
  - `rg -n 'creator run novel-'` returns ≥1 matches in the quickstart (multiple in §5) and consistent usage in both specs.
  - On-demand audit path referenced via overlay in novel-writing/quality-loop.md (points to `novel-manuscript-audit-review|extract` per the V1.45 compass and sibling spec).

### Cross-file consistency
- **novel-writing/author-experience.md and novel-writing/quality-loop.md**: consistent — both updated in lockstep with the quickstart. §2 table in novel-writing/author-experience.md now lists `creator bootstrap`; §3.4/§6 in novel-writing/quality-loop.md use `novel-review-master` preset-id form; "V1.45 Draft overlay — preset-id commands (applied P3 2026-06-14)" section records the exact changes.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md cross-link**: intact — quickstart retains the pre-release note linking to ARCHITECTURE.md for storage layout and the "Further Reading" table row. No drift introduced by P3.

### Source-of-truth alignment (vs actual CLI surface)
Post-`cargo build -p nexus42` binary (`target/debug/nexus42`) was queried:

- `nexus42 creator run --help` (last 20 lines): shows `[WORK_ID]` optional positional, `[EXTRA]...` for preset-specific args, `--force-gates --reason`, `--json`, `--verbose`. Matches quickstart usage of `creator run novel-writing <work_id>` and `creator run novel-review-master [<work_id>] ...`.
- `nexus42 creator bootstrap --help` (last 20 lines): exists with `--idea`, `--init-preset`, `--from-work`, `--set-default`, `--reason`, `--json`. Matches every bootstrap example in quickstart §2 and §6.
- `nexus42 creator works --help` (last 20 lines): lists `inspire`, `reopen`, `resume-chain`, `reconcile-chapters`, `status`, `completion-lock`, `pool`, etc. Matches all `creator works *` examples in quickstart §3–§6.
- No drift: all command examples in the three changed files are valid against the built surface. `command_surface_contract` test (37/37) explicitly asserts the V1.45 preset-id surface and absence of legacy subcommands.

## Compass §2 migration appendix coverage

| Old | New | Quickstart covers? |
|-----|-----|-------------------|
| creator run start | creator bootstrap --idea "..." | yes (§2, §6) |
| creator run continue | creator works inspire --note "..." | yes (§3 NOGO recovery, §4 inspiration, Part II-C) |
| creator run resume --reopen | creator works reopen --reason "..." | yes (§6 reopen path) |
| creator run resume | creator works resume-chain | yes (§4 daemon restart, §6 reopen) |
| creator run reconcile-chapters | creator works reconcile-chapters | yes (§4) |
| creator run stage list | creator works status | yes (throughout Part I; status is the visibility surface) |
| creator run stage advance --stage research | creator run research | no (research is advanced / non-default; not in Part I happy path) |
| creator run stage advance --stage produce | creator run novel-writing | yes (§3) |
| creator run stage advance --stage review | creator run reflection-loop | yes (§5, to generate findings) |
| creator run stage advance --stage persist | creator run kb-extract | no (advanced; not in Part I) |
| creator run audit-chapter | creator run novel-manuscript-audit-review\|extract | referenced via overlay (novel-writing/quality-loop.md); on-demand path noted |
| creator run review-master | creator run novel-review-master | yes (§5 primary path + flags) |

Relevant author-facing mappings for the quickstart (Part I happy path + reopen) are covered. Advanced FL-E stages and audit are intentionally out of scope for the minimal quickstart (correct per plan non-goals and compass).

## QC findings (consolidated from qc1/qc2/qc3)

- qc1 architecture: (no qc1.md committed at time of this QA run)
- qc2 security: Critical: 0, Warning: 0, Suggestion: 0 (verdict: Approve; docs-only surface review; all 8 checklist items passed, including information accuracy vs V1.45 surface, copy-paste safety, and three-plane IA consistency)
- qc3 performance: (no qc3.md committed at time of this QA run)

## QA-only findings

### Critical
- (none)

### Warning
- (none)

### Suggestion
- (none)

## Final Verdict

**Verdict**: PASS

Rationale: All three acceptance criteria (P3 plan §4) are met with reproducible evidence (rg output, binary help output, command_surface_contract test results, full file reads). CI gates are clean. The three changed documentation files are consistent with each other and with the actual post-P0/P1/P2 CLI surface on the integration branch. Compass §2 author-relevant mappings are covered where they belong in the quickstart. No Critical or Warning issues (QA or from the committed QC2). The scope is purely documentation (3 .md files); no product code, no schema, no test changes in this diff range.

## Summary
| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| 🔴 Critical | 0 |
| 🟡 Warning | 0 |
| 🟢 Suggestion | 0 |
